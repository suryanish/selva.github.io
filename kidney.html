<p><b>In humans, the kidneys are two reddish-brown bean-shaped blood-filtering organs[1] that are a multilobar multipapillary form of mammalian kidney, usually without signs of external lobulation.[2][3] They are located on the left and right in the retroperitoneal space, and in adult humans are about 12 centimetres (4+1‚ÅÑ2 inches) in length.[4][5] They receive blood from the paired renal arteries; blood exits into the paired renal veins. Each kidney is attached to a ureter, a tube that carries excreted urine to the bladder.</b></p>
